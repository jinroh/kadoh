# Description

The aim of this project is to write an implementation of the Kad system running in a browser environnement and especially in a mobile browser.

## Why is this challenging ?

### P2P need P2P communication

Kad is a _peer to peer_ system. That means that nodes (or peers) need to communicate directly to each other. The browser is not at all originally ready for P2P communications : it's based on a _server-client_ communication scheme. As client, the browser can retrieve information from the server, but the reverse path is not easy.

One of our challenge is to find a mean to enable a communicaton as direct as possible between mobile nodes.

_Hints_ : AJAX long-polling, WebSocket, Socket.io and XMPP over BOSH..

### Large scale-testing

To test our implementation we need some instance nodes of it - actually, quite a lot of nodes. Indeed, Kademlia is designed to be scalable and all the magic happens when it works with a huge amount of nodes.

One of our challenge is to test our system at large-scale.

_Hints_ : bots, proxy to existing DHTs..

# Install

To run KadOH you need __[node.js]__ (>= v0.4) and __[npm]__ \(node's packet manager\) to be installed.

## Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jinroh/kadoh.git
$ cd kadoh
```

## Install dependencies

You will need to install `libexpat` development package on Linux environments (should not be necessary on Mac OSX with XCode). For instance, on a Ubuntu machine, you'd have to run the folowing `apt-get` :

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libexpat-dev
```

Then enter the `git` repository and install the package dependencies using `npm`.

```bash
$ npm install
```
    
## Build the source tree

To build the source you can use :

```
$ jake build
```

This will build the main program in the `/dist` directory.

## Testing

We use [jasmine-node] and [jasmine-runner] for our testing on `node` and directly in the browser.

You can launch the test using the jake task `jake test:node` or `jake test:browser` which launch a HTTP server on `localhost:8124`.

## Launching you own DHT for testing

To launch you own DHT, you can use our built in scripts. The `dht` executable from the `bin/` directory is made for you. You can start different kind of DHT by writing a little configuration file in `json`. Examples can be found from the `lib/config` directory.

Here is an explanation of such configurations (be aware that comments are not allowed in JSON files) :

```json
{
  // transport type (xmpp or udp)
  "botType"  : "xmpp",
  // total size of the DHT
  "size"     : 100,
  // size of each pool
  "poolSize" : 30,
  // how many peers per seconds are launched
  "speed"    : 1,
  // activity per minutes per bots
  // no activity when set to false
  "activity" : 50,
  // number of values published by the bots on the DHT
  "values"   : 100,
  // when of type xmpp, you have to give the jid and passwords to launch multiple bots
  // here for instance the jids "kadoh0@jabber.org" .. "kadoh99@jabber.org"
  // with the password "azerty" will be used to connect the bots
  // if you remove the `%d', all bots will have the same address but will connect with different resources
  "jids"     : ["kadoh%d@jabber.org", "azerty"],
  // set to true if you want that this DHT launch the bootstraps processes
  "starter"  : true,
  // specify the bootstraps that will be launched (if starter) and used
  "bootstraps" : [
    ["kadohbootstrap0@jabber.org", "kadoh", "azerty"],
    ["kadohbootstrap1@jabber.org", "kadoh", "azerty"],
    ["kadohbootstrap2@jabber.org", "kadoh", "azerty"]
  ]
}

```

Any parameters added through the CLI will overwrite the one from the config files.

```bash
$ ./bin/dht --config udp.default.json --size=1000 --speed=4
```

After running this script, you should see each pool running after the other until all bots are launched.

To connect from the browser to the launched DHT, you can start a little HTTP server from our `apps` directory. For instance, if you have launched a UDP DHT, start the server as follow :

```bash
$ node apps/proxy/udp/app.js
```

You can connect then the DHT from you browser by going to `localhost:8080` and clicking on join.

If you have started a XMPP DHT, you should start the `apps/xmpp/app.js` HTTP server. Be aware that you might need to change the bootstraps from the `apps/xmpp/index.html` file to match your xmpp bootstraps.

## Mainline Proxy

You can test our implementation of the iterativeFindNode algorithm by launching a proxy server to the Mainline DHT.

Run with Node :

```bash
$ node apps/proxy/mainline/app.js
```

Then, in your browser go to `localhost:8080` and click on the `join` button. You can explore the iterativeFindNode algorithm steps with the buttons `prev`and `next`.
