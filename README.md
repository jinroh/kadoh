# KadOH - Javascript P2P framework

**KadOH** is a framework to build P2P applications for browsers and node.js. By implementing the basis of the [Kademlia DHT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia), KadOH lets you build **distributed web applications** for mobile and desktop devices. With its flexible and extensible design, you can easily adapt KadOH to fit your needs. KadOH is available under the [MIT License](/jinroh/kadoh/blob/master/LICENSE). 

KadOH abstract many different [transport protocols](/jinroh/kadoh/wiki/Transport) to provide P2P connections. In the browser we support [XMPP over Bosh](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0206.html) and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) shipped with a node.js router, and you can go for UDP and native XMPP in a node.js application. We plan to support **[WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/)** soon !

[See the wiki](/jinroh/kadoh/wiki) for more informations ! Also take look at [our report](http://jinroh.github.com/kadoh) and be aware that this document may be outdated.

## See it in action

**[Live demo](http://kadoh.fr.nf/)** based on XMPP transport running on Amazon EC2.

### Run it yourself

First you can start a little DHT based on UDP transport using this command :

```
bin/dht udp.default
```

Then in an other terminal, start the web-based [debug UI](/jinroh/kadoh/wiki/Debug-UI) using the following Jake command and go to `localhost:8080` :

```sh
jake run:udp
```

See the wiki for more informations on how to [launch your own DHT](/jinroh/kadoh/wiki/DHT-simulation) from scratch and on different environments.

## Installation

### Install KadOH

The only required dependency is [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (version >= 0.6, but you could try below..). Take a look at the [official manual](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager) to install node on your system.

Then run :

```sh
npm install kadoh
# or: git clone https://github.com/jinroh/kadoh.git
cd kadoh
npm install
```

You may also want to install the Jake module globally :

```
npm install -g jake
```

*For Linux users*, if the installation of KadOH's dependencies fails, you may need to install the `libexpat-dev` package. For Ubuntu/Debian users, run the following command :

```sh
sudo apt-get install libexpat-dev
```

### Build and go

#### Browser

To build the source inside the `dist` folder run one of the following Jake command :

```sh
jake build
```

This will build two versions of KadOH supporting different transports :

  - SimUDP using Socket.io
  - XMPP using Strophe.js for XMPP over Bosh

#### Node.js

If you need to use KadOH in a node.js application, just add `kadoh` in your package dependencies and use :

```javascript
var kadoh = require('kadoh');
```

## Thanks

KadOH is built on top of many open-source libraries and projects:

  - [Strophe.js](http://strophe.im/strophejs/)
  - [node-xmpp](https://github.com/astro/node-xmpp)
  - [cube](https://github.com/square/cube)
  - [klass](https://github.com/ded/klass)
  - [bncode](https://github.com/a2800276/bencode.js)
  - [socket.io](http://socket.io/)
  - [express](http://expressjs.com/)
  - [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)

## Tests

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jinroh/kadoh.png?branch=master)](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jinroh/kadoh?branch=master)

*For the moment, tests are not running anymore.. But we hope that will be fixed as soon as we migrate to Mocha.*

```
jake test:node
jake test:browser
